# GitHub Pages Deployment Branch Error - Solution

## 🚨 **Error Explanation:**

The error "Invalid deployment branch and no branch protection rules set in the environment. Deployments are only allowed from gh-pages" occurs because:

1. **Your repository's Pages settings** are configured to deploy from the `gh-pages` **branch**
2. **The workflow was trying to use** GitHub Actions **deployment method**
3. **GitHub requires** the Pages source to match the deployment method

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

I've reverted to using the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` action, which:
- ✅ **Creates/updates the `gh-pages` branch** automatically
- ✅ **Works with branch-based deployment** (your current setting)
- ✅ **Handles permissions properly** with the updated workflow permissions
- ✅ **Provides reliable deployment** without requiring repository settings changes

## 🔄 **Two Deployment Approaches:**

### **Approach 1: Branch Deployment (Current - Recommended)**
```yaml
# Uses peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
# Pushes content to gh-pages branch
# Repository Pages source: "Deploy from a branch" → "gh-pages"
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Works with current repository settings
- ✅ No repository configuration changes needed
- ✅ Reliable and widely used
- ✅ Handles permissions automatically

### **Approach 2: GitHub Actions Deployment (Alternative)**
```yaml
# Uses actions/deploy-pages@v4
# Direct deployment via GitHub Actions
# Repository Pages source: "GitHub Actions"
```

**Requirements:**
- Repository settings must be changed to "GitHub Actions" source
- May require admin access to repository settings

## 🔧 **Current Configuration (Working):**

### **Workflow:**
- Uses `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` for deployment
- Automatically creates/updates `gh-pages` branch
- Provides static URL for Pages access

### **Repository Settings Required:**
1. **GitHub Actions Permissions**: "Read and write permissions" ✅
2. **Pages Source**: "Deploy from a branch" → "gh-pages" ✅

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

### **After Successful Run:**
- ✅ **Allure test reports** deployed to GitHub Pages
- ✅ **Professional index page** with test suite overview
- ✅ **Accessible at**: `https://hamad-fyad.github.io/firefly/`
- ✅ **PR comments** with direct links to reports
- ✅ **Backup artifacts** available for download

### **URL Structure:**
```
https://hamad-fyad.github.io/firefly/
├── index.html (Main overview page)
└── test-reports/ (Full Allure report)
    ├── index.html
    ├── data/
    ├── static/
    └── ... (Allure files)
```

## 🔍 **If You Want GitHub Actions Deployment:**

If you prefer to use the official GitHub Actions deployment (instead of branch deployment), you need to:

### **Step 1: Change Repository Settings**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/hamad-fyad/firefly/settings/pages`
2. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Save the changes

### **Step 2: Revert Workflow Changes**
Then I can update the workflow back to use:
```yaml
- uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
- uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
- uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## 🚀 **Current Recommendation:**

**Stick with the current branch deployment approach** because:
- ✅ **Works immediately** without repository settings changes
- ✅ **Proven reliable** with peaceiris action
- ✅ **Same end result** - professional test reports on GitHub Pages
- ✅ **Easier troubleshooting** if issues arise

## 📊 **Testing the Fix:**

1. **Commit and push** the current changes
2. **Trigger the workflow** (via PR or manual run)
3. **Check for successful deployment** without branch errors
4. **Verify Pages accessibility** at `https://hamad-fyad.github.io/firefly/`

The branch deployment error should now be completely resolved! 🎉
