    Test System Information and Health Check Workflow
    
    Purpose:
        Validates that the Firefly III instance is healthy and returns proper system information.
        This is often the first test to run to ensure basic connectivity.
    
    What it tests:
        - API endpoint accessibility (/about)
        - Response structure contains required system information
        - Version information format validation
        - Basic authentication works
    
    How it works:
        1. Makes GET request to /about endpoint with authentication headers
        2. Validates HTTP 200 response (service is running)
        3. Checks response contains version, api_version, and php_version fields
        4. Validates version format follows semantic versioning (contains dots)
    
    Business Value:
        - Ensures the system is operational before running financial tests
        - Validates API versioning for compatibility checks
        - Confirms authentication is working properly
